This github demonstrates the data analysis associated with the m7G-MaP-seq method.

In m7G-MaP-seq, the specific sensitivity of m7G to mild reduction with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is exploited.
The reduction leads to formation of RNA abasic sites in the RNA. Reverse transcription with reverse transcriptase records
the positions of m7G modifications directly as mutations in the cDNA. In parallel, a non-NaBH4-treated sample is prepared.
The treated and control samples are used used to prepare libraries for sequencing. At least one treated and one control sample
is required, but m7 detection is improved when replicates are included.


The data analysis starts with 
The resulting data is mapped to a relevant reference using local alignments and high sensitivity settings
Finally, the mutation rate is calculated, and the corresponding mutation rate obtained in the non-reduced control sample is 
subtracted to give a mutation rate difference for each position. 

The method requires at least two fastq files (control and NaBH4 treated) and a Fasta.
